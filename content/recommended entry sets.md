# Considering a Drum Kit Purchase?
<br><br><br><br>

### The Three Main Parts (Usually Purchased Separately)

1. **Drum shells**  
2. **Hardware** (pedals, stands, throne/seat)  
3. **Cymbals**  



<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

### Key Questions

- Do I want something they can **grow into** if they really love drumming?  
- Or do I just want something **playable for now** to see if the interest sticks?  

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

### All-in-One Beginner Packages

- Most “everything included” kits are not great value.  
- Cymbals in these sets are usually *placeholders*—they make a cymbal-like sound but you’ll eventually want real ones.  
- Still, they can be a good **temporary solution** if you just want to test the waters.

### Buying Used

- Local marketplaces (like Facebook) can offer very great deals.  
- Selection is hit-or-miss, having some guidance is recommended.

### Recommended New Paths
- **Cheapest entry:** (Around $350) a small all-in-one kit (good for trying it out, but temporary).  
  - This is the best all-in-one option I've seen: [Ludwig-Questlove](https://a.co/d/as3NZBy)

- **Step up:** (Around $950) cheapest kit + **Quality cymbals** = solid starter setup.  
  - The all-in-one but with real cymbals: [Ludwig-Questlove](https://a.co/d/as3NZBy) + [Dream Crash/Ride](https://a.co/d/74wCcVR) + [Dream Hi Hat](https://a.co/d/6U7LlzQ)

### A Few Extra Notes

- There are plenty of options that fall between these price points, but choosing one of the above routes usually saves money in the long run.  
- The **all-in-one option** is the cheapest unless you buy used, but you’ll almost certainly need to upgrade to real cymbals (and possibly another kit) if they continue playing.  
- The **middle option** includes quality cymbals that can grow with the student and hold resale value, letting you recover part of your investment later.  
- The **final option** provides a compact, high-quality setup that can be played for years with no major upgrades needed beyond normal wear-and-tear.
